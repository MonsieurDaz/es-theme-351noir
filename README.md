## 351 Noir 351ELEC Theme

This is a modern dark 351ELEC theme heavily based on the [Epic Noir](https://github.com/c64-dev/es-theme-epicnoir) theme (and thus, original ideas by Chicuelo and brought to life in collaboration with Nick - c64-dev - L).

### Installation and Updating

1. Download the .7z file from the [Releases section](https://github.com/MonsieurDaz/es-theme-351noir/releases) and extract it.

2. Copy the es-theme-351noir folder to `~/.config/emulationstation/themes` in the ext4 partition of 351ELEC.

Or just download the theme from the Theme Downloader within 351ELEC.

### Theme Notes

This theme supports video. You can also use a scraped image in conjunction with the video. If you scrape both, when a game is selected, it will show the screenshot for a couple of seconds before fading and playing the video.

Game screenshots are not included within the theme. You can scrape your own - you should use game boxart/screenshots and/or videos.

### Screenshots
